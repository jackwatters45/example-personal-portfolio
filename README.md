# personal-portfolio

This is an example personal portfolio project - a simple website that showcases my work and provides a way for people to contact me. It is built using in React and uses some Typescript - my first time using it.

It is not up to date and was primarily an introduction to react / some more interesting frontend design concepts. This is not a reflection of my current portfolio website. For that see: <https://jackwatters.dev/>.
