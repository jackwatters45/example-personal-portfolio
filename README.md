# personal-portfolio

This is an example personal portfolio project - a simple website that showcases my work and provides a way for people to contact me. It is built using in React and uses some Typescript - my first time using it.

It is not up to date and was primarily an introduction to react / some more interesting frontend design conecpets.

I plan on adding more features to this project in the future to display my front end skills, but for now it is a decent base and a nice intro to responsive design.
